Theory of Gravitation

An arcade game in which we take control over the gravitation. Sometimes it is trickyto come up with a way to finish a level.

This is a project for 'Projekt Programistyczny' course at Jagiellonian University.

Currently the project is at its early stage.

BUILDING and RUNNING:
./build.sh
./run.sh

TODO:
- design interesting objectives, add power ups, etc
- design an interesting model for the main character
- create levels
- improve graphics
- sounds, music
- design a simple menu
- test for memory leaks

ideas for future development:
- a program for creating levels?
- saving / loading a state of the game
- documentation? :)
- using a nice building & distributing tool

hard-core ideas:
- multiplayer
